Here is a description of the vector field files:

  center.vec   - flow is in a circle around a center critical point
  circles.vec  - 90 rotation of dipole, making two centers
  const1.vec   - vertical constant field
  const2.vec   - diagonal constant field
  const3.vec   - horizontal constant field
  cylinder.vec - ideal flow around a cylinder
  dipole.vec   - dipole (two point charges)
  saddle.vec   - saddle critical point
  source.vec   - all flow is away from center
  spiral.vec   - spiral created by turning a source's vectors by 45 degrees
  vnoise.vec   - vector field noise

Here are some streamline files made from the vector fields above
and the "stplace" commands that created them:

  dipole_example.st  - from dipole.vec (tufts .04 .1)
  vnoise_example.st  - from vnoise.vec (opt 0.03)
